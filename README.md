# ServerBasedChat
Server Based Chat Using Python

This branch implements a simple server. ChatDriver tests out functionality by sending a message from one client object to another.

Some notes: This code currently only works if it's run on one computer. We will need to hardcode in the server address and its welcoming 
port if we would like it to work on different machines

The code should be fairly self-explanatory. Let me know if you want me to change anything/don't understand the code.
